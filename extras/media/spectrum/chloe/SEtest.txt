Chloe 280SE test program
========================

This program tests the Chloe 280SE's video modes and sideways RAM.

Three blocks of 32K are loaded into the top half of the DOCK, EX and HOME banks.

These blocks contain 2 hi-res, 2 hi-col, and 4 lo-res screens at 8K offsets.

The lo-res screens are copied to the lower 16K of the DOCK and EX banks.

When a key is pressed, the program then cycles through the display modes,
copying data from the DOCK or EX banks to either page 5 or page 7 of the HOME
bank in the following order:

1. lo-res 1, bank 5
2. lo-res 2, bank 5, offset 8K
3. lo-res 3, bank 7
4. lo-res 4, bank 7, offset 8K
5. hi-res 1, bank 5
6. hi-res 2, bank 7
7. hi-col 3, bank 5
8. hi-col 4, bank 7
