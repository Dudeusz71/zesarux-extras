**STOCKS AND SHARES 3 v.2.0**

This is a simple trading game of skill and luck.
The aim is to make as much money as possible.

In each **BUYING ROUND** you must buy a 
minimum of 5 and a maximum of 50 shares in
each company **ONCE ONLY AND IN ANY ORDER**, 
so try and maximize your portfolio.

In each **SELLING ROUND** you must sell
a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 50 shares
depending on how many shares you have in
a given company. You must trade with each
of the companies **ONCE ONLY AND IN ANY ORDER**, 
so try to maximize your portfolio.

But don't get to gung-ho, the market can
sting you at any time and wipe out your
portfolio in a single stroke. Would it be best
to work quickly and cash in or play the long
game and hope for a bigger return? **IT'S
UP TO YOU**

I hope you enjoy my game especially written for the mighty ZX80.
