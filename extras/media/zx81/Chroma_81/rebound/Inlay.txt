REBOUND


HOW TO PLAY

Knock all the blocks out of the court by using your bat to deflect the ball toward them.

Sometimes a bonus token will fall from a block, granting a power-up if collected:

+1	Extra Life	Player is granted an extra life (up to a maximum of 9)
>>	Next Level	Player is immediately moved to the next level.
££	Extra Score	Player's score is increased.
FB	Fire Bullets	Use FIRE to launch bullets from the player's bat to help remove blocks.
GB	Grab Ball	Player's bat will 'catch' the ball - use FIRE to launch it again.
SB	Smash Ball	Ball won't rebound when a block is hit, but will instead continue onwards regardless.
X3	Multi-Ball	Ball will be split into three.
ZZ	Slow Ball	Ball will move much slower, making it easier to catch.

Collecting a bonus token will remove any currently active benefit.


HINTS

Some blocks will require more than a single hit to remove them.
Crossed blocks ('XX') cannot be removed.
The direction the ball will rebound from the player's bat is different depending on where it hits the bat - Use this to help control the ball to remove the last remaining blocks.


CONTROLS

Z - Move left.
X - Move right.
L - Fire.
P - Pause the game.

All keys can be redefined by pressing R on the main menu.

The ZXpand joystick interface is also supported, and automatically detected, replacing the direction and fire keys.

The game will be in colour if the Chroma 81 interface is detected, and set to show colour.
