<p><em>WhatNow?</em> is an application that can load and play
many freely-available text-only and text/graphic adventures on your Z88.
It is a complete emulation of <em>Incentive</em>'s <strong>Graphic
Adventure Creator</strong> (or <strong>GAC</strong>) runtime system.</p>
<p>Using this application you can play many adventure games that were
released in the eighties for the <em>Sinclair ZX Spectrum</em> and
<em>Amstrad CPC 464/664/6128</em>; titles
such as <em>Book Of The Dead</em>, <em>Frankenstein</em>, <em>Karyssia -
Queen Of Diamonds</em>, <em>Mountains Of Ket</em> and more.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you feel so inclined, you can use your own Speccy (or
one of the many emulators) to create your own adventures with
<strong>GAC</strong> so that they can be enjoyed by Z88 users. If there is
any interest in doing this, I might even consider adding an adventure
compilation feature to <em>WhatNow?</em>, so get writing!</p>
<p>New in the latest release (v1.11) is full support for all GAC
adventures produced for the <strong>Amstrad CPC</strong> range of
computers, the ability to continue typing and playing the adventure while
pictures are still being drawn, and a bugfix.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Loading GACed adventures</h2>
<p>The standard Z88 menu system is used throughout <em>WhatNow?</em>. When
you first enter the system, or when you close an adventure file, you will
arrive at the title screen. From here, you can use commands on the
<strong>File</strong> menu.</p>
<p>If you choose a command but change your mind, you can cancel by
pressing ESCape in the dialog box that appears.</p>
<h3>Load file</h3>
<p>This command allows you to select a <strong>GAC</strong> datafile
(either by selecting from the <em>Filer</em> or simply typing the name) to
load and play. Some datafiles can be obtained from this site below. If you
write your own adventure on the Spectrum, using the "save datafile" option
will produce a file suitable for <em>WhatNow?</em>.</p>
<p>The system will take a few moments to load the file and ensure that it
is a valid <strong>GAC</strong> datafile. After that, you will enter the
game.</p>
<h3>Close file</h3>
<p>When used from within a game, this command returns you to the main
title screen, where you can choose to load another adventure.</p>
<h3>Quit</h3>
<p>Terminates the application.</p>
<h3>Extract file</h3>
<p>If you obtain Spectrum snapshots or tape images from the internet or a
CD-ROM, you can use this option to attempt to extract any
<strong>GAC</strong> datafiles within them. This works with most snapshot
and tape images, the most common being TAP, TZX and SNA. If in doubt, try
using the option anyway; the worst that can happen is that no game will be
found!</p>
<p>During the extraction process, only a cursory inspection of the data is 
made, so it's possible that datafiles that don't work will be produced 
(the load file option makes a thorough check of the data and will 
refuse to run an invalid game).</p>
<p>Some GAC games were saved on tape as a number of separate blocks rather 
than as a single chunk, and these will not in general be extracted 
properly (for example, <em>Frankenstein</em>). If you run into this
problem, you  will have to load the game into a Spectrum emulator and take
a snapshot; datafiles can then be extracted from the snapshots.</p>
<p>The extract command continues searching a file even after successfully 
extracting a datafile, so if you give it a TAP or TZX file containing a 
multi-part adventure, all parts will be extracted. The first part is 
always given the <strong>.gac</strong> extension, with other parts being
called <strong>.ga2</strong>, <strong>.ga3</strong> and so on.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no way to extract files from the popular Z80
snapshot format. To get around this, you will have to convert these
snapshots to the SNA format (or similar) using an emulator or other
conversion utility.</p>
<p>Version 1.11 now includes full support for <strong>Amstrad
CPC</strong> games. The extract option is capable of producing datafiles
from snapshots or uncompressed tape images of these games, but disk files
(<strong>.dsk</strong>) are <em>not</em> supported.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Parser</h2>
<p><em>WhatNow?</em> provides a complex parser which can understand a
variety of sentences. Rather than entering single commands, you can enter
many in one go, separating them with "and", "then" or punctuation. The
system also understands the use of the word "it" to refer to the last
object mentioned. For example, you could enter:</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Get the lamp, light it and go east. Go south
then get the rat.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, you can abbrieviate words as much as you like,
and the parser will do its best to understand what you mean.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Graphics</h2>
<p>Within the limits of the Z88 display, pictures are displayed as 
accurately as possible. However, since the height of the display is 
only half that used on the Spectrum, some distortion is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Spectrum colours are given different shading patterns when used to fill 
areas. However, due to the Spectrum's unusual display arrangement, 
which is effectively a two-colour display overlaid with colour 
information, some pictures may look slightly odd if the designer has 
tried to be clever in the use of ink and paper colours. This is 
particularly noticeable in the example adventure, <em>Ransom</em>.</p>
<p>Graphics from <strong>Amstrad CPC</strong> games can look even more
peculiar, due to the four-colour system used which cannot be easily
reproduced on the Z88.</p>
<hr>
<h2>User-defined graphics (UDGs)</h2>
<p>Although GAC did not provide any way of using the Spectrum's
user-defined graphics facility, many games included an alternate character
set (for a more pleasing typeface), and some of them used a few of the
symbol characters as user-defined graphics.</p>
<p>Due to differences between Z88 and Spectrum character definitions, it
is not
possible to automatically extract any of these UDGs from snapshot files.
However, special <strong>.udg</strong> files are now available for some
games, and these add the graphic characters found in the Spectrum versions
to the Z88.</p>
<p>To allow UDGs to be displayed, you must keep the <strong>.udg</strong>
file together with the adventure datafile, and they must have the same
name. For example, if you have <em>botd1.gac</em> and <em>botd1.udg</em>
in the same location the UDGs will be
automatically installed when you load the adventure.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Game commands</h2>
<p>During gameplay, there are a few commands on the <em>Game</em> menu
that you can use.</p>
<h3>Load position</h3>
<p>Allows you to load a previously saved position. Most adventures also
allow you to type "load" to perform the same function.</p>
<h3>Save position</h3>
<p>Similarly, lets you save your current position to a file. You can
usually type "save" to do this as well.</p>
<h3>Restart</h3>
<p>Restarts the adventure. Well, what did you expect? ;-)</p>
<hr>
<h2>Options</h2>
<p>A number of options are available to affect the way the system behaves.
These can be selected at any time, whether playing a game or not.</p>
<h3>Graphics on</h3>
<p>Splits the display into a text window at the left, and a graphics
window at the right. In most adventures, you can also type "pictures"
for the same effect. You can select this even if the adventure is
text-only, if you prefer a narrow text window.</p>
<h3>Text only</h3>
<p>Devotes the entire width of the display to text. This can also usually
be selected from within an adventure with the "text" command.</p>
<h3>Pause mode</h3>
<p>If a large amount of text is being displayed, having this option on (it
is on by default) means that the system will pause to let you read the
text before scrolling it off the screen.</p>
<h3>Scroll mode</h3>
<p>If you prefer, you can select scroll mode which lets text scroll
through the screen without any pauses.</p>
<h3>Trap errors</h3>
<p>This option, set by default, means that <em>WhatNow?</em> will stop the
game with a report if an error in the GAC game file is encountered.</p>
<h3>Ignore errors</h3>
<p>If you find a particular game has errors in it (eg <em>Matt Lucas</em>
often causes a "Stack imbalance" error), you can use this option to simply
ignore them and allow you to continue playing.</p>
