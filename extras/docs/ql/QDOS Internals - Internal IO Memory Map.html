<H2 Align=LEFT>Internal I/O Memory Map</H2>
<P>On the original QL, there is an area from $18000 to $1BFFF in the <A HREF="memory.html">memory map</A> set aside for internal I/O.
These memory addresses and decoded by the hardware devices attached and used to control these devices. The following gives details of which 'port' is used and for which device.
Be aware that all ports are byte sized (unless I tell you diffferent) and that reading and writing them directly can cause problems.</P>

<H3>Problem areas</H3>
<P>OK, I have a couple of problems with this documentation. 
<P>The first is, if these ports are mapped onto a memory address, how come PC_CLOCK is a long word
(4 bytes) and yet is mapped to 2 bytes $18000 and $18001 ?
<P>The second may be explained by this. Note that PC_TDATA and PC_TRAK1 share an
address. Is this the reason why you cannot use the serial ports when a
microdrive is running ?
<P>You will note that although only a few addresses are used for the hardware
ports, the entire block of memeory from $18000 to $1BFFF is set aside - what has
happened to the other (nearly) 16Kb of RAM ?
<P>The answer is simple, in order to keep costs down, less address lines that
were required were used to decode the port address and this causes 'shadows' to
appear all through this 16Kb of RAM. The RAM is unusable as it will inflict
serious hardships on the devices.


<H3>Using the hardware</H3>
<P>The hardware ports cannot really be used from within a user program. At
least, not usefully (according to Andy Pennell).
<P>There are of course, a couple of exceptions.</P>
<P>The clock long word can be read and contains the date and time in seconds as a 32 bit integer. Zero represents January 1 1961 at 00:00:00.
<P>If you attempt to write to the clock port, you will effectively reset it to zero. Use the proper QDOS routine, <A HREF="trap1.html">manager trap (MT_SCLCK)</A>, to set the clock.</P>

<P>The other exception is the master chip status port which you can only write
to. This controls the screen and the data written is as follows :</P>
<TABLE BORDER=2 BGCOLOR="#c6eff7">
<TR><TH BGCOLOR=CYAN>Bit </TH><TH BGCOLOR=CYAN>Purpose </TH></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>1 </TD><TD>0 = Screen on </TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER> </TD><TD>1 = Screen off </TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>3 </TD><TD>0 = 4 colour (mode 4) </TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER> </TD><TD>1 = 8 colour (mode 8) </TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>7 </TD><TD>0 = Use screen 0 (allegedly at $20000) </TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER> </TD><TD>1 = Use screen 1 (allegedly at $280000) </TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>A copy of this register is stored at affset $34 in the <A HREF="svars.html">system variables</A>
