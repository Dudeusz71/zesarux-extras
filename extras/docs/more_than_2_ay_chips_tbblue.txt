sid.rar
Velesoft converted a song with 3AYs and write  a quick test
the second RAR is the SIDplayer
copy sidplay to bin folder
and
.sidplay oceall5.dmp
this sidplay is a rough test. It works, but it is not check if file exist and you cant abort.
but it working and you can test the tunes on SID, when you write this part
Thanks a lot!
I will try it

the IC selection still the same
TS is 111111 XX
I suppose 255 value for first chip, 254 for second and 253 for third, right?

11 to 1st ay, 10 to 2nd, 01 to 3rd and 00 to SID
yes
I made a change to pan the channels, but you can start with these.
TBBlue now uses bit 6 and 5 to pan
1LR111XX
its compatible with original TS, because the tracas are selected by 111111XX, got it?
Example:
select 2nd AY with audio on Right side only
10111110
2nd AY, left side only 11011110
3rd AY, both sides: 11111101
Great!
I don't still emulate stereo so it's easier for me ðŸ˜‰




so, no problem then... ðŸ˜€
