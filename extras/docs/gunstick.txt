A PEN LIGHT GUN FOR ZX SPECTRUM

 
The ZX were the most widespread weapon lightgun and-STICK GUN. 


SINCLAIR lightgun (ZX 128)

Is readable registry port number 14 AY (#FFFD), which are used only 2 bits: D0: no significance D1: no significance D2: no significance D3: no significance D4: Photodiode (log.1 detecting the passage of the light beam) D5 : KEY FIRE (log.0 = PRESSED THE FIRE / FIRE log.1 out) D6: no meaning D7: no meaning








Port #FFFD (65533) is actually AY port to which it is connected by ZX 128 and take KEYPAD RS232. An original lightgun for the ZX joined the law into connector KEYPAD and involved is as follows: PIN3 = photodiode PIN5 = KEY FIRE PIN1 = GND Pin6 = + 12V

GUN-STICK

Compared lightgun ma-STICK GUN advantage that is mounted over the ZX classic JOYSTICK Kempston interface (like UR-4) or the place SINCLAIR joystick. Thus connected, the gun can therefore be used for all ZX and nothing we do not interfere with port AY as a lightgun. I mapped the test routine for her-STICK GUN and here is a description of the port. GUN-STICK can be connected to port 31 (Kempston), or as SINCLAIR 1 and 2.

Connection via port # 1F (31 or Kempston) :

D0: no significance 
D1: no significance 
D2: Photodiode (log.1 detecting the passage of the light beam) 
D3: no significance 
D4: KEY FIRE (log.0 = PRESSED THE FIRE / FIRE log.1 out) 
D5: no meaning 
D6: no significance 
D7: no meaning

Connection via port #EFFE (or 61438 SINCLAIR 1 = klavesy6-0)

D0: KEY FIRE (log.0 = PRESSED THE FIRE / FIRE log.1 out) 
D1: no significance 
D2: Photodiode (= log.0 detecting the passage of the light beam) 
D3: no significance 
D4: no meaning 
D5: no meaning 
D6: no significance 
D7: no meaning

Connection via port # F7FE (or 63486 SINCLAIR 2 = klavesy1-5)

D0: no significance 
D1: no significance 
D2: Photodiode (= log.0 detecting the passage of the light beam) 
D3: no significance 
D4: KEY FIRE (log.0 = PRESSED THE FIRE / FIRE log.1 out) 
D5: no meaning 
D6: no significance

Some games for STICK GUN-game support two players at once, and in that case counts connectivity through two gun SINCLAIR 1 and 2 When selecting one player to reckon with attached gun as SINCLAIR 1 (keys 6-0), or the port 31 seats Kempston joystick. Her on-STICK GUN there is only about 7 and lightgun so well. Handler for both types of gun works on exactly the same principle, and the renumbering of the test port and the Swap bit of a lightgun game can be used with the GUN-stick, or even reversed. strongly suggest as the best way to use light gun connections on port 31 (Kempston). While this means that the software will not work for lightgun or for-STICK GUN ala SINCLAIR. Games GUNSTICK who read from port 31 are probably only two, one of which has an option SINCLAIR / Kempston. But it is not nothing easier than to rewrite port numbers and all software and modify port on the 31st Tech 12-13 games can handle overwrite per day. Linking ala SINCLAIR is useless, because the vast majority of light gun is powered directly from the connector CANON, where of course u SINCLAIR missing joystick + 5V. U of some missing Kempston INTERFACE + 5V take, but for us to use fortunately UR-4, which has brought out watering. (Brand new, still unwrapped interface UR-4 can still buy for example in Prague in the bazaar for INTEGRA 99 Kc) well integrated connector for Kempston joystick has also K-MOUSE INTERFACE, at the moment I have a flare gun linked. There are also reductions for connection two gun on one connector for CANON Kempston INTERFACE. Nowhere Unfortunately I could not find a description of the connection to the other player, or software that uses this.
